\usage{
bound_outcome_tmle(dat, var)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A dataframe containing the variables of interest. A tibble.}

\item{var}{The variable name corresponding to the outcome to be bounded. A string.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the bounded outcome. A tibble.

\description{
In order to be able to use TMLE with a continuous outcome,
it is necessary to bound it between 0 and 1. This function performs
the necessary steps.
